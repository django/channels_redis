3.3.1 (2021-09-30)
------------------

Two bugfixes for the PubSub channel layer:

* Scoped the channel layer per-event loop, in case multiple loops are in play
  (#262).

* Ensured consistent hashing PubSub was maintained across processes, or process
  restarts (#274).


3.3.0 (2021-07-01)
------------------

Two important new features:

* You can now connect using `Redis Sentinel
  <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel>`. Thanks to @qeternity.

* There's a new ``RedisPubSubChannelLayer`` that uses Redis Pub/Sub to
  propagate messages, rather than managing channels and groups directly within
  the layer. For many use-cases this should be simpler, more robust, and more
  performant.

  Note though, the new ``RedisPubSubChannelLayer`` layer does not provide all
  the options of the existing layer, including ``expiry``, ``capacity``, and
  others. Please assess whether it's appropriate for your needs, particularly
  if you have an existing deployment.

  The ``RedisPubSubChannelLayer`` is currently marked as *Beta*. Please report
  any issues, and be prepared that there may be breaking changes whilst it
  matures.

  The ``RedisPubSubChannelLayer`` accepts ``on_disconnect`` and
  ``on_reconnect`` config options, providing callbacks to handle the relevant
  connection events to the Redis instance.

  Thanks to Ryan Henning @acu192.

For both features see the README for more details.


3.2.0 (2020-10-29)
------------------

* Adjusted dependency specifiers to allow updating to the latest versions of
  ``asgiref`` and Channels.


3.1.0 (2020-09-06)
------------------

* Ensured per-channel queues are bounded in size to avoid a slow memory leak if
  consumers stop reading.

  Queues are bound to the channel layer's configured ``capacity``. You may
  adjust this to a suitably high value if you were relying on the previously
  unbounded behaviour.


3.0.1 (2020-07-15)
------------------

* Fixed error in Lua script introduced in 3.0.0.


3.0.0 (2020-07-03)
------------------

* Redis >= 5.0 is now required.

* Updated msgpack requirement to `~=1.0`.

* Ensured channel names are unique using UUIDs.

* Ensured messages are expired even when channel is in constant activity.

* Optimized Redis script caching.

* Reduced group_send failure logging level to reduce log noise.

* Removed trailing `:` from default channel layer `prefix` to avoid double
  `::` in group keys. (You can restore the old default specifying
  `prefix="asgi:"` if necessary.)


2.4.2 (2020-02-19)
------------------

* Fixed a bug where ``ConnectionPool.pop()`` might return an invalid
  connection.

* Added logging for a group_send over capacity failure.


2.4.1 (2019-10-23)
------------------

* Fixed compatibility with Python 3.8.


2.4.0 (2019-04-14)
------------------

* Updated ASGI and Channels dependencies for ASGI v3.


2.3.3 (2019-01-10)
------------------

* Bumped msgpack to 0.6

* Enforced Python 3.6 and up because 3.5 is too unreliable.


2.3.2 (2018-11-27)
------------------

* Fix memory leaks with receive_buffer

* Prevent double-locking problems with cancelled tasks


2.3.1 (2018-10-17)
------------------

* Fix issue with leaking of connections and instability introduced in 2.3.0


2.3.0 (2018-08-16)
------------------

* Messages to the same process (with the same prefix) are now bundled together
  in a single message for efficiency.

* Connections to Redis are now kept in a connection pool with significantly
  improved performance as a result. This change required lists to be changed
  from oldest-first to newest-first, so immediately after any upgrade,
  existing messages in Redis will be drained in reverse order until your
  expiry time (normally 60 seconds) has passed. After this, behaviour will
  be normal again.


2.2.1 (2018-05-17)
------------------

* Fixed a bug in group_send where it would not work if channel_capacity was set


2.2.0 (2018-05-13)
------------------

* The group_send method now uses Lua to massively increase the speed of sending
  to large groups.


2.1.1 (2018-03-21)
------------------

* Fixed bug where receiving messages would hang after a while or at high
  concurrency levels.

* Fixed bug where the default host values were invalid.


2.1.0 (2018-02-21)
------------------

* Internals have been reworked to remove connection pooling and sharing. All
  operations will now open a fresh Redis connection, but the backend will no
  longer leak connections or Futures if used in multiple successive event loops
  (e.g. via multiple calls to sync_to_async)


2.0.3 (2018-02-14)
------------------

* Don't allow connection pools from other event loops to be re-used (fixes
  various RuntimeErrors seen previously)

* channel_capacity is compiled in the constructor and now works again


2.0.2 (2018-02-04)
------------------

* Capacity enforcement was off by one; it's now correct

* group_send no longer errors with the wrong ChannelFull exception


2.0.1 (2018-02-02)
------------------

* Dependency fix in packaging so asgiref is set to ~=2.1, not ~=2.0.0


2.0.0 (2018-02-01)
------------------

* Rewrite and rename to channels_redis to be based on asyncio and the
  Channels 2 channel layer specification.


1.4.2 (2017-06-20)
------------------

* receive() no longer blocks indefinitely, just for a while.

* Built-in lua scripts have their SHA pre-set to avoid a guaranteed cache miss
  on their first usage.


1.4.1 (2017-06-15)
------------------

* A keyspace leak has been fixed where message body keys were not deleted after
  receive, and instead left to expire.


1.4.0 (2017-05-18)
------------------

* Sharded mode support is now more robust with send/receive deterministically
  moving around the shard ring rather than picking random connections. This
  means there is no longer a slight chance of messages being missed when there
  are not significantly more readers on a channel than shards. Tests have
  also been updated so they run fully on sharded mode thanks to this.

* Sentinel support has been considerably improved, with connection caching
  (via sentinal_refresh_interval), and automatic service discovery.

* The Twisted backend now picks up the Redis password if one is configured.


1.3.0 (2017-04-07)
------------------

* Change format of connection arguments to be a single dict called
  ``connection_kwargs`` rather than individual options, as they change by
  connection type. You will need to change your settings if you have any of
  socket_connect_timeout, socket_timeout, socket_keepalive or
  socket_keepalive_options set to move them into a ``connection_kwargs`` dict.

1.2.1 (2017-04-02)
------------------

* Error with sending to multi-process channels with the same message fixed

1.2.0 (2017-04-01)
------------------

* Process-specific channel behaviour changed to match new spec
* Redis Sentinel channel layer added

1.1.0 (2017-03-18)
------------------

* Support for the ASGI statistics extension
* Distribution of items over multiple servers using consistent hashing is improved
* Handles timeout exceptions in newer redis-py library versions correctly
* Support for configuring the socket_connect_timeout, socket_timeout, socket_keepalive and socket_keepalive_options
  options that are passed to redis-py.

1.0.0 (2016-11-05)
------------------

* Renamed "receive_many" to "receive"
* Improved (more explicit) error handling for Redis errors/old versions
* Bad hosts (string not lost) configuration now errors explicitly

0.14.1 (2016-08-24)
-------------------

* Removed unused reverse channels-to-groups mapping keys as they were not
  cleaned up proactively and quickly filled up databases.

0.14.0 (2016-07-16)
-------------------

* Implemented group_channels method.

0.13.0 (2016-06-09)
-------------------

* Added local-and-remote backend option (uses asgi_ipc)

0.12.0 (2016-05-25)
-------------------

* Added symmetric encryption for messages and at-rest data with key rotation.

0.11.0 (2016-05-07)
-------------------

* Implement backpressure with per-channel and default capacities.

0.10.0 (2016-03-27)
-------------------

* Group expiry code re-added and fixed.

0.9.1 (2016-03-23)
------------------

* Remove old group expiry code that was killing groups after 60 seconds.

0.9.0 (2016-03-21)
------------------

* Connections now pooled per backend shard
* Random portion of channel names now 12 characters
* Implements new ASGI single-response-channel pattern spec

0.8.3 (2016-02-28)
------------------

* Nonblocking receive_many now uses Lua script rather than for loop.

0.8.2 (2016-02-22)
------------------

* Nonblocking receive_many now works, but is inefficient
* Python 3 fixes

0.8.1 (2016-02-22)
------------------

* Fixed packaging issues
